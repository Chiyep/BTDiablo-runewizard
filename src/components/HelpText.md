## What is it?

The Runewizard lets you check easily what [runewords](http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/items/runewords.shtml) you can make with the [runes](http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/items/runes.shtml) you have on a Diablo II character.

It is compatible with Diablo II LoD version 1.14 (patches after 1.11 didn't introduce new runewords).

Click on the runes to mark which ones you have found. The available runewords will be highlighted automatically.

The table can be sorted, try clicking on "Type" to sort runewords by equipment type, you may find it useful!

## Runes

The runes are listed in order of rarity, from top to bottom, and left to right. Each vertical group of rune represents roughly **Common**, **Semi-Rare**, and **Extremely Rare** runes. Note that the order is consistent with the [rune upgrade formulas](http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/items/cube.shtml) for the Horadric Cube. For example: 3 x Tal = 1 x Ral rune.

## Runewords

Ladder-only runewords have a small <span class="rw-Md-ladder">L</span> icon next to the name.
